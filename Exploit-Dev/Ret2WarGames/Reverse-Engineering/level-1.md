# Notes on the Level 1 Reverse Engineering challenge 
## Valid Serial

### We are given a binary which has been disassembled and have access to the ASM instructions through a similar interafce to Binary Ninja. The C source is limited by and only shows the main function, which is just an overview of what the bin does i.e Enter a name, check the name is non zero or abort, then enter a serial number and check if its valid or abort.

## The Mission
### Serial CrackMe
We've gotten access to a specialized piece of software... but we can't use it! It keeps asking us for our name and a serial number. Can you help us get around this?? 

## C Source

## Disassembly (ASM)

## What now?

To solve the chanllenge we have to reverse engineer the algorithm used to produce a valid serial. The challenge also gives us access to a debugger, so we can step through the code and inspect register values or memory locations. 

The first step is tp figue out what the assessmble routine is doing.
