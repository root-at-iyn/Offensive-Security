# Nightmare -  Intro to Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering

Nightmare is a free ctf-based course on reverse engineering and binary exploitation targeted at beginners. It does require some understanding of programming (C, Python), however there are some challenges that introduce you to x86_x64 assembly. Its been a few years since I've done any binary reversing or exploitation, and I have not attempted advanced teqchniques like ROP chains, heap exploits, bypassing DEP and ASLR ... etc. I thought this would be a good referesher and opportunity to learn so I will attempt these challenges. Although the [Nightmare](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare) repo does include the writeups to the challenges I will avoid resorting to that. The goal is to learn, battle through, research, and understand how to find vulnerabilities, why they are vulnerable, and why particular exploit techniques work.  

This repo just contains the writeups to these challenges that I have solved.
