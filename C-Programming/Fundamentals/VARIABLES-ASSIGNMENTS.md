# Working with Variables
## TL;DR
- When we want to store a value for reuse in our program we need to assign the value to a variable
- When we assign variables, we are asking the OS to allocate memory on the stack (which is local to our running process) 
- In C, before you can use a variable you need to `declare` the variable specifying the data type that will be stored in the variable
- Each data type has a size which is defined in bytes. Eg. an `int` is 4 bytes and a `char` is 1 byte (a byte is 8 bits)
- When you define a variable name, this is also termed an `indentifier`. Identifiers are case-sensitive and must start with a character, eg. `a-z`, `A-Z`, or `_`
- Identifiers can include alphanumerics or underscores
- Identifiers cannot be one of the `keywords` used in the C language. Keywords in C have special meaning to the complier.
