# C++ Programming
### C++ is a superset of the C Programming language and has backward compatibility, meaning C programs will run in C++ envrionments.
### Since C++ is interoperable with C and has a low-level programming capability, i.e control over memory mangement :smirk: it also has the potential for programming errors that can cause memory curruption vulnerabilities

### The aim here is to learn the C++ programming language enough to be literate in reading, understanding and writing code. The overall goal is to read exploit PoCs and find vulnerabilities in source code.
