# Offensive Security Notes

## Want to learn offensive security independently? So do I:exclamation: :smirk:
### Lets face it, learning offensive security without a background in computer science or programming is a challenging feat. I've created this repo to teach myself offensive security from the ground up, the way I would have liked someone to have shown me when I started out. I don't aim to be perfect here, and this repo should pretty much be treated as my notes, but hopefully it will be helpful to someone searching for answers in the same way I am.
